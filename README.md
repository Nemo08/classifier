# Neurlang Binary Classifier

* A machine learning algorithm for training binary classifiers of integers.
* It works best when the size of the true set and the false set is almost the same.
* Maximum problem size is limited to 2 x 65536 values (2 sets of size 65536)
* The resulting models are very fast (they are hash based)
